        <p>
            I am 23 yo. I started to learn programming around April 2021. I started from HTML, CSS, JavaScript. My best fiend was already Senior web-developer, and he helped me. Now i have knowledge that allows me to get applied to job. The issue is that I live in Ukraine, and its difficult to get applied here, also my knowledge is rather confused, so now im truing to refresh it and learn something new to finally get a job
